Eligibility EPIC 3.1: Addon Covers Page
Business Logic: This epic populates the "Addon Covers" page in the final Excel report. It determines the binary "Yes/No" status for key endorsements by searching the policy text for specific keywords and their common abbreviations. Currently, it actively checks for the following five endorsements:

Ambulance Cover (Endt. No. 16)

Convalescence Benefit (Endt. No. 15)

Critical Illness Benefit (Endt. No. 20)

Daily/Hospital Cash Benefit (Endt. No. 14)

Doctor & Nurse Home Visit Cover (Endt. No. 17)
